Simple SQL migration tool.

Tested with SQLite, PostgreSQL, Snowflake

# Install

`npm i sql-migrate-up`

# Usage

Here is an example of your `migrate` command:

```typescript
import { runCli } from "sql-migrate-up";
import { getDbClient, stopDbClient } from "./client";

runCli({
  schema: "public",
  folder: "./migrations",
  table: "migrations",
  parameters: async ({ schema }) => ({ schema }),
  query: async (query) => {
    const client = getDbClient();
    return client(query);
  },
  end: stopDbClient,
});
```

The example above is in TypeScript, use your favorite build tool to make an executable script or simply add it to package.json scripts section.

If you run it with no parameters you'll see help:

```
‚ùØ ./migrate
Usage: migrate [options] [command]

Options:
  -V, --version               output the version number
  -h, --help                  display help for command

Commands:
  up [options]                run all migrations
  create [options] [name...]  create a new migration file
  help [command]              display help for command
```

You can run help for any command like `migrate help create`.

All commands take the following arguments to override default values:

- --schema <string> schema to migrate
- --table <string> migrations history table name
- --folder <string> folder with migrations files

## run-once vs. run-always

All migrations are split into two categories:

- **run-once** - default, normal migration file that will be kept in a history table and run only once.
- **run-always** - migration file that needs to be run after all migrations every time. Useful for `create or replace` views, functions, etc.

`run-once` always runs first and then `run-always`.

**Always use `migrate create <name> [--run-always]` to create a new migration**

## SQLUp Options

- name, <string> ("migrate") - the name of the script
- version, <string> ("version of this package") - version of the script
- schema, <string | null> ("public") - schema, if schema is set to `null` to schema will be enforced
- folder, <string> or <(schema: string) => string> ("./migrations") - folder with migrations files, or a functinon that returns a folder
- table, <string> ("migrations") - the name of the table to keep the history of migration
- now, <string> ("now()") - the sql function for getting current timestamp
- _parameters_, async function that should resolve into a data object that will be applied to every migration file
- _query_, async function that runs SQL
- end, async function that will be run after all is done. The perfect place to close your connections

## API: runMigrations

`runMigrations` take all the same arguments except `end`. Returns a number of applied migrations.

```ts
import { runMigrations } from "sql-migrate-up";

import { getDbClient, stopDbClient } from "./client";

const migrations = await runMigrations({
  schema: "public",
  folder: "./migrations",
  table: "migrations",
  parameters: async ({ schema }) => ({ schema }),
  query: async (query) => {
    const client = getDbClient();
    return client(query);
  },
});
```

## Versioning

This is advance option and you probably will never need it. However it is very usefull when you have mutliple parallel instances of the same script trying to migrate one schema.

### Options

- _version_, <string> required version of your package
- _useVersioning_, <true> sets the migrations to be in versioning mode.

How it works. If version changes works as usual, if version did not change no migration (not run-once, not run-always) will be applied.
